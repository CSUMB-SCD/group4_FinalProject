                <h3><strong>Our Motivation:</strong></h3>
                <p>This software assists with evaluating new movies and users can straightforwardly make a decision whether to order a tickets in advance or wait until it appears on Netflix.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>Our Approach and Technologies:</strong></h3>
                <p><em>Technologies:</em> Application will be programmed on Cloud9 using JavaScript and JQuery in conjunction with PHP. Our application logic will be implemented in JavaScript/PHP and will run on Heroku. For our database we used JawsDB - Database(databites) to create, edit, and save reusable queries against your provisioned server. Databites are a custom, zero-hassle reporting solution for your database right out of the box. This also allowed us to have a persistent connection that wouldn't log out.
                </p>
                <p><em>Platform:</em> Our website will be pushed onto Heroku as it has automatic deployment features, scalability, analytical data, and developer focused.
                </p>
                <p><em>Web client:</em>  jQuery/JS/HTML5/CSS will be used for dynamic interactive user experience, and to access our API.
                </p>
                <p><em>Searches:</em>  We will be implementing the Bootstrap Table With Sorting, Searching and Paging using dataTable.js for user searches. As it is built on Bootstrap and will enable responsive searches.
                </p>
                <p><em>APIs:</em>We are using the themoviedb API to obtain information on Producers and Actors/Actresses.
                </p>
                <p><em>User Login:</em> Create account (Username, password). Once created, it will be stored in our database. When people log in, their username/password will be verified and checked that itâ€™s in our database.
